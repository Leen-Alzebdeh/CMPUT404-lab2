Q1. By socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM). The arg SOCK_STREAM Provides sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams, which defines TCP. 

Q2. They are different in how they are used. A server binds to an address and port, and accepts requests. A client connects to an address and port.

Q3. bY s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1). The arg socket.SO_REUSEADDR lets OS bind to the same port address again.

Q4. You get the connection and the address of the connection. 

Q5. These calls return the number of bytes received, or -1 if an error occurred. When the stream socket has shutdown, the return value will be 0. 

Q6.
